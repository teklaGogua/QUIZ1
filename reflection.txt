Reflection on Java Quiz

1. Challenges Faced and Solutions:
- Challenge: Understanding nested package structures and proper import statements between packages.
  Solution: I carefully mapped the directory structure to match the package declarations and practiced with simpler examples first.

- Challenge: Calculating profit correctly while handling mixed units (lari and tetri).
  Solution: I standardized all values to tetri before calculations and added comments to document conversions.

- Challenge: Implementing encapsulation with private variables while still allowing necessary access.
  Solution: I used getter methods to maintain proper OOP principles while providing controlled access.

2. AI Tools Utility:
AI tools were extremely helpful for:
- Clarifying Java syntax for package declarations and imports
- Providing instant feedback on proper directory structures
- Explaining currency unit conversion best practices
- Generating example code snippets for reference
- Debugging through step-by-step analysis of my errors

The AI served as an interactive learning aid, but I made sure to understand each concept it explained rather than just copying solutions. 
This helped me internalize the Java constructs that were new to me, particularly regarding package organization and financial calculations in OOP.
